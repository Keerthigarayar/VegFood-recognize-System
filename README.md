# VegFood-recognize-System

Overview
The Veg Food Recognition System is a web-based application that uses machine learning and computer vision to recognize and classify veg food items. The system consists of a frontend web interface for uploading images of veg food items and a backend server that processes the images and returns the recognition result.

Features
Recognize and classify veg food items using machine learning and computer vision
Provide dietary management, obesity control, health level balancing, food quality prediction, and density measuring information for each recognized food item
User-friendly web interface for uploading images and viewing recognition results
Technical Requirements
Node.js and npm (for the frontend)
Python and pip (for the backend)
TensorFlow and Keras (for the machine learning model)
OpenCV (for image processing)
Flask (for the backend web framework)
Pillow (for image processing)



Getting Started
   *Frontend
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the frontend directory.
Run the command npm install to install the required packages.
Run the command npm start to start the development server.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend application.

   *Backend
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the backend directory.
Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages.
Run the command python app.py to start the Flask development server.
The backend server will start listening on http://localhost:5000.

 *Using the Application
Open the frontend application in a web browser (http://localhost:3000).
Select an image of a veg food item using the file input field.
Click the "Recognize Food" button to send the image to the backend server for processing.
The backend server will process the image and return the recognition result to the frontend application.
The frontend application will display the recognition result, including the food name, dietary management, obesity control, health level balancing, food quality prediction, and density measuring.
